# Binarization-DIBCO
### Bridging the Binary Divide: A Comparative Analysis of OTSU, Niblack, and K-Clustering Techniques in Binarization for DIBCO Dataset

## Problem (Provided):
Explore the realm of document binarization, a crucial process in image processing. The goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of two selected binarization techniques from the literature, apply them to a relevant dataset, and rigorously evaluate their performance. The entire process will be documented in a 5-6 page paper-like format, accompanied by an oral presentation. This assignment aims to develop students' skills in image processing, critical analysis, and effective communication, providing a practical and hands-on approach to document binarization techniques.

### Learning Objectives:
• Understand the concept and significance of document binarization.
• Select and preprocess a relevant dataset for document binarization tasks.
• Explore and comprehend two different binarization techniques from the literature.
• Implement selected techniques on the dataset and conduct a detailed performance evaluation.
• Develop analytical skills to compare and contrast the performance of the chosen techniques.
• Effectively communicate findings through a well-structured written paper and an engaging oral presentation.

### Selected Techniques:
OTSU, Niblack, and K-Clustering
